# Sequential Art

## Sequential Art Workflow

There are two viable options:

**OPTION 1.** Single PSD file

```
	* Do this if the order of the images / frames will change
	* Do not do this if you need many / detailed layers

	+ Easy to reorganize
	+ Manage large image / frame counts easier
	+ Good for sketches / roughs
	+ Work from a template
	+ Work on every image / frame simultaneously
	+ Ready to export as a single board

	- Large file size
	- Tedious to save individual images / frames
	- Not for final images or detailed sketches
```

**OPTION 2.** Multiple PSD files / images

```
	* Do this if the order of the images / frames is locked (no changes or infrequent changes)
	* Do this if the files require many / detailed layers

	+ Link multiple detailed finals back into one PSD
	+ Good for finals / detailed sketches
	+ Work on each image in a larger / final format (HD, 4K)
	+ Individual files can be larger

	- Painful to rename and reorganize files intuitively (on the fly, without human error, quickly)
	- Harder to work across all images / frames simultaneously
```

It's roughly the same amount of work in both cases to save a single board and individual frames. This will lean in one direction depending on which is required.

### Sequential Art Layers

`OPTION 2` has no issues with layer density or file size outside of the normal constraints you'd encounter for any image.

`OPTION 1` has two efficient layering approaches:

```
# Flat Layers
Foreground Sketch Layer
Background Sketch Layer
```

```
# Grouped Frames
Group/Frame001
	|_Foreground Sketch Layer
	|_Background Sketch Layer
Group/Frame002
	|_Foreground Sketch Layer
	|_Background Sketch Layer
etc...
```

Ideally you'd use the `Grouped Frames` method giving you the most control and portability in moving individual layers around with the cost of slightly more overhead.

The `Flat Layers` method is best suited for storyboards that will be super rough / early stage, where all of the foreground / background line art shares a single layer. This is slightly more intuitive to work with but less portable and forgiving when rearranging frame order.

### Mixing Workflows

There's no reason not to mix all of these in whatever path to completing your goal is most efficient.

For example:

- Start with `OPTION 1` to develop roughs
- Switch to `OPTION 2` after roughs are approved for the remainder of the project
