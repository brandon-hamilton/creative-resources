The idea is you create a fake file to blend in with other files on your device (<code>Latest_Job_Notes.docx</code> or the classic <code>Passwords.xlsx</code> which hopefully you are not doing for real). You have no reason to ever touch or open that file once you plant it on your machine, in the cloud, or on a mobile phone, so you know if it's accessed, either an application is being bad and reading your files like malware would, or you may have just gotten a heads up on being compromised by malware.</p> <p>This holds true for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS -- it's not a problem unique to Windows. The techniques may be different for each (and so is setting up certain types of canary tokens for that matter) but the attack unfolds generally the same.

Photoshop reads them and updates their content in the linked file.</p> <p>This is because Photoshop doesn't understand if the same files had their naming convention changed, it will simply be looking for the same file path to update linked content. If you need file versions maintained based on dates or any other reason, create a separate folder such as <code>YEAR.MONTH.DAY</code> and copy the required files into that folder.

Fortunately, we can make this easy to do.</p> <ul> <li>Ctrl+t to Transform, adjust the scale % in the <code>menu bar</code> (W + H should scale together) until the image content adheres to the frame template<ul> <li>This works because the newly linked frame, while larger than the template, is centered horizontally and vertically above the smart object it replaced</li> <li>Scaling prevents the need for any manual transforming of the layer shape by hand</li> </ul> </li> <li>Once you find the exact percentage, you can apply it to every subsequent frame without manually transforming it</li> <li>Further automate this by turning the scale % into an Action, now you just click the \"play\" button on each image layer after linking a file</li> </ul> <p>This template structure will update all
