# Project Scoping

This comes in many forms. Two examples:

## Where you are are tasked with working on a project:

Questions to ask on a scoping call for a project.

**NOTE**: in this case, billing or other details external to the work itself would have already been discussed and agreed upon.

You can stick to answering just the numbered points below. Ask more questions if necessary.

#### 1. Timeline and deadlines
	- Internal reviews / deadlines
	- External reviews / deadlines
#### 2. Expectations of updates and drafts?
	- Timing / frequency
#### 3. Expectations of deliverables and end result?
	- File format?
	- Layers?
	- Line Art? B&W? Color?

**Electronic delivery**

	- Single Document (e.g. PDF, Word, PSD)?
	- Individual Documents (e.g. SVG, PSD, PNG)?
	- Pre-existing template?
	- Resolution + DPI?

**Physical delivery**

	- Frame? Matte?
	- Printing logisitcs
		* Where / what printing services are available
		* Test prints?
		* Cost
	- Shipping logistics
		* Timeframe (e.g. days vs week+)
		* Packaging (e.g. how / what materials are needed to protect + ship the item)
		* Cost
	- Cost of all materials?

#### 4. Availability of photo / art assets of product / brand / concept for use?

	- Time to build mood board if assets are provided
	- Time to build mood board if assets are not provided

## Where you're managing the project:

- Defining the scope of a project.
	* What is the long term goal
	* What short term goals are required to reach the long term goal
	* Time available vs time required
	* Budget available vs budget required
	* What roles are required (people, services)?
	* Documentation + legal paperwork required (IP rights, NDA, work-for-hire)?
