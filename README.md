### Goal of this Project

The goal is for this to be an exhaustive list of tools, methods, resources, and cheat-sheets in an open repository that accepts pull requests to cover new or missing data, and can be forked by you to modify, use, and improve upon.

As weird as it sounds this idea was inspired by projects like [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) and [HackTricks](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks), which made me realize something like this does not exist for our industry. Hopefully together we can change that, and help others in learning more efficiently. ðŸ™Œ
