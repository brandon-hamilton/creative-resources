# Image Recon

Methods for discovering images for reference or use in work.

- [Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en&fg=1)

- [DuckDuckGo Search Syntax](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/)

## Finding Images of a Certain License

| Search Engine | Query                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Google`      | Images > [search-query] > Tools > Usage Rights > [license]                                       |
| `DuckDuckGo`  | [search-query] > Images > All Licenses > [license] (Free to Modify, Share, and Use commercially) |

## Discovery Process

**EXAMPLE**: You're tasked with creating an image with multiple subjects at a high angle.

1. Search literally
	* e.g. 'high angle'

Searching the usual asset repositories with queries for `high angle`, `birds eye view`, or `overhead` doesn't yeild anything immediately usable.

How else can we think about this to solve the problem?

2. Search abstractly
	* 'parkour'
	* 'skateboarding'
	* 'breakdance'

Thinking like this will open new paths in your search.

## Product Assets

Sometimes you'll be tasked with work containing an existing product, but the client doesn't have any assets for you to work with aside from those in a deck.

In cases like these the references from a deck may already be in situ (e.g. in a frame) and at an angle that isn't what you need.

Using any 2022 vehicle `model` + `manufacturer` as an example; you already know the following:

- Exact type or version of the product
- Maker of the product
- How the product should look

To solve this, query the product manufacturer's website directly using google / duckduckgo search syntax:

- site:`manufacturer`.com filetype:png
- site:`manufacturer`.com filetype:jpg
- site:`manufacturer`.com filetype:gif
- site:`manufacturer`.com filetype:jpeg
- "`model`" site:`manufacturer`.com
- "`model`" "2022" site:`manufacturer`.com
- "`model`" "interior" site:`manufacturer`.com
- "`model`" "exterior" site:`manufacturer`.com

You want to obtain these assets directly from the product / manufacturer's website.

**Why?**

While not ideal it's the best option you have to gather the required assets when they are not provided.

This is not a perfect solution, there may be cases where a client, product manufacturer, or otherwise may not have limitless rights to the imagery on their own site.

**EXAMPLE**: If an individual or entity photographs their own vehicle and shares that on social media, the copyright to the *image* is technically that individual's and not the manufacturer's.

**Always check with your point of contact before beginning, for usage requirements and availability of assets.**

## Image Sets

This table is only an example that may or may not grow over time. 

Create your own reference library to save you time and keep you focused on the visual problem solving!

# Image Licensing:

Obtain and [archive a copy](https://web.archive.org/) of the license agreement to every asset purchased, or service you use to generate imagery for commercial / personal work

For example, keep a spreadsheet of assets and sources, or even a simple note with a template of asset, filename, source uri, and license information, which you can reuse for each project to track these.

The following licenses are examples of what you'll want to look for when sourcing or buying assets to use in your work. The Photobash.co license is a particularly great example of the wording you may need to cover your usage requirements.
