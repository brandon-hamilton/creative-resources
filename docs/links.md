**TIP**: When joining Discord communities via links on mobile:

- Invite links look like this: `https://discord.gg/<url>`
- `Tap-hold` to copy the `https://discord.gg/<url>` link
- Open the Discord app (not a browser) and navigate to the `+` icon below all of your servers
- Select `Join a server` at the bottom to paste this link manually into that field

This will safely allow you to join servers and avoid potential redirects.

**TIP**: To log out of Discord on other devices:
