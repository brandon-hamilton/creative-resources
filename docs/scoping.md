# Scoping

This comes in many forms. Two examples:

## Joining a Project

Where you're tasked with working on a project. Questions to ask on a scoping call for a project.

**NOTE**: in this case, billing or other details external to the work itself would have already been discussed and agreed upon.

### 1) Timeframe

- Internal reviews / deadlines
- External reviews / deadlines

### 2) Updates / Drafts

Expectations of updates.

- Timing / frequency
- Types of drafts

### 3) Deliverables

Expectations of deliverables.

- File format?
- Layers?
- Line Art? B&W? Color?

#### Electronic Delivery

- Single Document (e.g. PDF, Word, PSD)?
- Individual Documents (e.g. SVG, PSD, PNG)?
- Pre-existing template?
- Resolution + DPI?

#### Physical Delivery

- Printing logisitcs
	* Where / what printing services are available
	* Test prints?
	* Cost
- Shipping logistics
	* Timeframe (e.g. days vs week+)
	* Packaging (e.g. how / what materials are needed to protect + ship the item)
	* Cost

### 4) Asset Usage

## Managing a Project

Where you're managing the project.

- Defining the scope of a project.
	* What is the long term goal
	* What short term goals are required to reach the long term goal
	* Time available vs time required
	* Budget available vs budget required
	* What roles are required (people, services)?
	* Documentation + legal paperwork required (IP rights, NDA, work-for-hire)?
